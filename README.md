## Overview
**Foreman the Mill** is a unique genre-bending Pico-8 game that combines intense action platforming with relaxing simulation elements. 

By night, you are the Foreman, defending the mill from a horde of bureaucratic zombie civil servants using your trusty shotgun. By day, you relax on your boat, fishing for rare catches to stock your tank and sell at the market.

## Features
*   **Day/Night Cycle**: Two distinct gameplay modes.
*   **Action Arcade Shooter**: Classic 8-bit run-and-gun gameplay inspired by *Duke Nukem 2*.
*   **Fishing Simulator**: Relaxing fishing mechanics inspired by *Dave the Diver*.
*   **Management Sim**: Care for your fish in a Tamagotchi-style tank to increase their value.
*   **Economy**: Sell your catch to earn wages and upgrade your gear.
*   **Romantic Ending**: Earn enough for retirement to unlock a special ending scene!
*   **Dynamic Soundtrack**: Features 8-bit tracks in styles ranging from *Noisia* to *Bossa Nova* and *Thai Pop*.

## Story
The Mill is under attack! The endless paperwork and red tape have manifested as literal zombies. Only the Foreman can stop them. But a man has to eat (and retire), so when the sun comes up, the gun goes down and the fishing rod comes out. 

His goal? Save up $500 to retire to a private island with his supermodel Thai wife.

## How to Play
